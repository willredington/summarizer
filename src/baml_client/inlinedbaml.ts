**Direct Task Relevance**: Does the content directly address the user's current work or immediate needs?\n    - **Skill Level Appropriateness**: Is the content suitable for the user's expertise level in the specific domain?\n    - **Role Alignment**: Does the content match the user's professional responsibilities and daily duties?\n\n    ### Secondary Relevance Factors (Weight: 30%)\n    - **Learning Gaps**: Does the content help fill knowledge gaps mentioned in the user's profile?\n    - **Tool/Technology Match**: Does the content cover tools, languages, or technologies the user works with?\n    - **Practical Application**: Can the user immediately apply this information to their work?\n\n    ### Contextual Factors (Weight: 20%)\n    - **Experience Transfer**: Can the user leverage their existing skills (from other languages/tools) with this content?\n    - **Depth Appropriateness**: Is the content at the right technical depth (not too basic, not too advanced)?\n    - **Workflow Integration**: Does the content fit into the user's existing development workflow?\n\n    ### Quality Indicators (Weight: 10%)\n    - **Content Freshness**: Is the information current and up-to-date?\n    - **Source Authority**: Is the source reputable and trustworthy?\n    - **Completeness**: Does the content provide actionable, complete information?\n\n    ## Selection Process\n\n    1. **Profile Analysis**: \n      - Identify user's expertise level in the search topic area\n      - Note specific technologies, tools, and methodologies they use\n      - Understand their role requirements and daily responsibilities\n      - Identify stated knowledge gaps or learning areas\n\n    2. **Content Evaluation**:\n      - Score each result against the relevance factors above\n      - Consider how the content serves their immediate vs. long-term needs\n      - Evaluate if the content complexity matches their skill level\n      - Assess practical applicability to their current projects\n\n    3. **Ranking Strategy**:\n      - Prioritize content that directly supports their current work\n      - Favor content that builds on their existing expertise\n      - Include diverse perspectives when multiple high-quality options exist\n      - Balance immediate utility with strategic learning value\n\n    ## Output Requirements\n\n    Return the top 3-5 most relevant results with:\n    - **Selected Results**: The chosen search results in order of relevance\n    - **Relevance Reasoning**: 2-3 sentence explanation for each selection explaining why it's valuable for this specific user\n    - **Confidence Score**: 1-10 rating of how well the selection matches the user's needs\n\n    ## Example Application\n\n    For a user profile like:\n    ```\n    Role: Technical Architect and Senior Software Engineer  \n    Skills: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang\n    Learning Area: Ruby (new to the language)\n    Daily Work: API design, internal tools, system design\n    Experience Level: Senior in general programming, beginner in Ruby\n    ```\n\n    Selection would prioritize:\n    - Ruby content appropriate for experienced programmers new to Ruby\n    - Practical Ruby development guidance over theoretical concepts\n    - Content that leverages their existing programming knowledge\n    - Tools and approaches relevant to API development and internal tooling\n\n    ## Key Considerations\n\n    - **Avoid Beginner Bias**: Don't select overly basic content for experienced developers learning a new technology\n    - **Context Over Keywords**: Prioritize contextual relevance over simple keyword matching\n    - **Practical Over Academic**: Favor actionable content over purely theoretical discussions\n    - **Current Over Comprehensive**: Select immediately useful information over exhaustive references\n\n    Remember: The goal is to provide the most immediately valuable and actionable information for this specific user's current situation and learning journey.\n\n    Here are the search results:\n    {{ searchResults }}\n\n    Here is the user profile:\n    {{ userProfileSynopsis }}\n\n    You will need to return the summary in the following format:\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\n\ntest get_relevant_results {\n  functions [GetRelevantResults]\n  args {\n    searchResults [\n      InputSearchResult {\n        url: \"https://jaceksamol.com/2023/09/10/the-ultimate-showdown-rvm-vs-asdf-which-is-the-superior-choice/\",\n        title: \"Introduction to Ruby Version Managers (RVM) and ASDF\",\n        content: \"Choosing the best Ruby version manager depends on your specific needs and preferences.
